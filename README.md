In this repository I am demonstrating a non-working example of QA testing for automation testing and selenium.


Within this in order to execute I would configure TestNG and modify the JDK settings in order to execute. I would like to note that within this JDK settings there are a plethora of boxes to fill but for reference VM options would be one of the top configurations to set since it is important in order for the automation to work an example will look like something below:

-VM Options:
-Dscreensize.type="Desktop"
-﻿Ddata. type="Live"
﻿-Dauthentication.mode="Desktop"
﻿-Dexecution.type="Browser"
﻿-DLanguage. type="English"
﻿-Denv.resources="resources/*type of environment*"
﻿-Dcucumber. filter. tags=" (@CPP_1)"
﻿-Dproject.module.name-"CPPWELCOMEPAGE"
